This is the third homework assingment for UCI Coding Bootcamp.
The assingment was to make a password generator that would take user input to generate a new password.
Intial prompt alerts the user that their password has expired and that this tool can help them in the generation of a new password.
Once the user clicks on the generate password button they are presented with a series of prompts, asking which type of characters they would like to include.
The password can contain special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.
The password can be any length between 8 and 128 characters.
If the user choose a character length outside this range they will be given an alert asking them to choose a number within the given range.
After the user chooses which type of charaters they want in the password, they will be presented with a new password.
